# INVENT: Turn Thoughts into Ideas

INVENT is a tool we created to help students who are struggling to come up with project ideas. We identified this common challenge through numerous conversations with students and educators, who consistently highlighted the difficulty of finding inspiring project concepts. This widespread feedback made it clear that many students were getting stuck at the ideation stage, unsure of what to build.

Here's what INVENT does:
- You tell it what technologies you know, your skill level, and how much time you have, specific theme if any.
- It then uses Gemini AI to come up with three unique project ideas just for you.
- Each idea consists description, features, impact, step-by-step implementation strategy, and recommended tech stack.
- You can click ‘Generate more’ to generate more ideas.

Key features:
- Idea Retention: If you like an idea, you can "reserve" it so other students using the app won't get the same suggestion.
- Chat with Ideas: You can ask questions about the ideas to get more details.
- Easy Idea Sharing: It's easy to share the ideas - you can copy them or save them as a PDF.
- High-accuracy Responses: The Gemini-1.5-Pro Model ensures that generated ideas are relevant, innovative, and aligned with the user's specifications.
